# About Me

Hi! I’m **Maggie Garcia** — a writer, editor, and researcher with a strong focus on clarity-driven communication and thoughtful information design. I specialize in taking broad, complex ideas and distilling them into content that is clear, accessible, and easy for readers to use.

I recently completed my **BA in English**, where I developed a deep foundation in analytical writing, research methods, revision strategy, and project management. My work includes:

- A 150-year literary analysis examining themes of isolation in feminist literature  
- A fully structured **LEH Rebirth Grant proposal** for a Louisiana oral-history podcast  
- A curated capstone portfolio featuring revised essays, personal literary philosophy, and polished academic writing  

## What I Do Well

- **Clear, concise writing** grounded in reader needs  
- **Technical documentation**, including user guides, troubleshooting instructions, and structured walkthroughs  
- **Editing and revision** with a focus on clarity, coherence, and tone  
- **Research**, especially synthesizing large bodies of information into digestible insights  
- **Organized, calm project execution**, even during fast-moving or ambiguous situations  

## How I Work

I write with intention, structure, and empathy. I enjoy creating information that genuinely helps someone—whether it’s guiding a user through a new tool, clarifying a confusing process, or shaping complex concepts into usable knowledge.

My background in childcare and household management also reflects another side of my skillset: adaptability, emotional intelligence, independent problem solving, and the ability to stay composed during unpredictable situations. These strengths now inform my approach to documentation and communication.

## What I’m Looking For

I’m currently pursuing opportunities in:

- Technical writing  
- Content development  
- Editing  
- Documentation and knowledge management  

I’m excited to bring my analytical strengths, writing experience, and user-centered mindset into a professional documentation or content role.

Thanks for taking the time to learn a little about me — I hope you enjoy exploring the rest of my portfolio!
