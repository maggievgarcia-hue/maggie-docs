# Editing Sample

This sample demonstrates your ability to clarify, restructure, and improve ambiguous or disorganized writing.

---

## Original Text (Before)
*"Users should sometimes try to check the sync settings because if something is not working right then maybe it's a syncing problem and the user might want to see if the notes are in the right folder or not because sometimes they aren't."*

---

## Revised Text (After)
**To resolve most syncing issues:**
1. Open **Settings → Sync**  
2. Ensure syncing is enabled  
3. Verify that your notes appear inside the correct folder  
4. If problems continue, run a manual sync or restart the app

- Removed ambiguous language (“sometimes”, “maybe”)  
- Added direct verbs (“Open”, “Ensure”, “Verify”)  
- Reorganized information logically  
- Focused on user action rather than speculation  

This sample highlights:
- Editing clarity  
- Structural reorganization  
- Reader-centered communication
